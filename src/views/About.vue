		<h1>Something about Vue.js</h1>

		<p>
			Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building
			user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
			and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that
			helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.
		</p>

		<p>
			The above example demonstrates the two core features of Vue:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Declarative Rendering: Vue extends standard HTML with a template syntax
				that allows us to declaratively describe HTML output based on JavaScript
				state.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reactivity: Vue automatically tracks JavaScript state changes and
				efficiently updates the DOM when changes happen.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			You may already have questions - don't worry. We will cover every little
			detail in the rest of the documentation. For now, please read along so you
			can have a high-level understanding of what Vue offers.
		</p>

			All that glitters is gold Only shooting stars break the mold Hey now,
			you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star,
			get the show, on get paid And all that glittersis gold Only shooting stars
			Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?

		<h1>Progresive framework</h1>

		<p>
			Vue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common features
			needed in frontend development. But the web is extremely diverse - the
			things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With
			that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable.
			Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Enhancing static HTML without a build step
			</li>
			<li>
				Embedding as Web Components on any page
			</li>
			<li>
				Single-Page Application (SPA)
			</li>
			<li>
				Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
			</li>
			<li>
				Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)
			</li>
			<li>
				Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial and
			guide only require basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge, and you should be
			able to follow along without being an expert in any of these.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are an experienced developer interested in how to best integrate
			Vue into your stack, or you are curious about what these terms mean, we
			discuss them in more details in Ways of Using Vue.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is shared
			across all these use cases. Even if you are just a beginner now, the
			knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you grow to tackle more
			ambitious goals in the future. If you are a veteran, you can pick the
			optimal way to leverage Vue based on the problems you are trying to solve,
			while retaining the same productivity. This is why we call Vue "The
			Progressive Framework": it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt
			to your needs.
